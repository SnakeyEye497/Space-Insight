# 🚀 Space Insight

**Space Insight** is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and visualizing space-related dataset using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration and model development.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`Codes.Run/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`Results/`**: Houses output files, including plots, metrics, and model predictions.
- **`dataset/`**: Includes raw and processed datasets utilized in the project.
- **`models/`**: Stores trained model files and related artifacts.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview and guidance on using the repository.

## 🧪 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on space datasets.
- Implementation of machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Visualization tools to interpret model outcomes.
- Modular code structure for scalability and ease of use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
